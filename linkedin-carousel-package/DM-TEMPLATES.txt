DM #1: FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKED THE POST
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Hey [First Name] - saw you checked out the AI compliance audit.

Quick question: does [Company Name] use any AI screening tools (HireVue, MyInterview, etc)?

Most companies I audit are missing 6-8 compliance requirements and don't even know it. Takes about 10 minutes to review your setup.

Want me to send you a quick gap analysis checklist?

DM #2: FOR PEOPLE WHO COMMENTED (Positive/Concerned)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[First Name] - thanks for the comment on the compliance post!

Since you're already thinking about this, want to do a quick 10-min audit call this week?

I can tell you exactly where your gaps are and what it costs to fix vs. what it costs if you get sued.

Most companies I work with are non-compliant in 8-12 areas. Takes 2 weeks to fix, prevents years of legal headaches.

What's your calendar look like tomorrow or Thursday?

DM #3: FOR PEOPLE WHO COMMENTED (Defensive/Skeptical)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Hey [First Name] - saw your comment.

I get it - compliance feels like overkill until you see the first lawsuit.

I worked with a company last month that thought they were fine. They'd been using HireVue for 2 years.

Then an EEOC complaint landed. $75K in legal fees later, they wished they'd spent $3K upfront to get compliant.

Not trying to fearmonger - just offering to help you avoid that scenario.

Want me to send you the actual NYC Local Law 144 requirements? Takes 2 min to read, then you can decide if it's relevant.

DM #4: FOR HR/TALENT LEADERS (Based on their title)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[First Name] - saw you're the [VP of Talent/Director of HR] at [Company].

Quick question: if your team is using AI screening tools, who owns compliance?

In most orgs I work with, it falls in a gap:
- Legal says "Talk to HR"
- HR says "Talk to IT"
- IT says "The vendor handles it"

Meanwhile nobody's done a bias audit in 18 months.

I help talent teams get ahead of this - usually takes 2 weeks, costs less than one legal consultation.

Worth a 15-min call this week?

DM #5: FOR PEOPLE WHO SHARED THE POST (Hot leads!)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[First Name] - really appreciate you sharing the compliance audit!

Since this is clearly relevant to your world, want to talk specifics?

I'm doing free 15-min gap analysis calls this week for companies using AI screening. I'll tell you exactly:

✅ Which regulations apply to you
✅ Where your biggest risks are
✅ What it costs to fix (usually $3-5K)
✅ What it costs if you don't (easily $50K+)

No pressure - if you're already compliant, I'll tell you that too.

What's your calendar look like tomorrow afternoon?

DM #6: FOR VENDOR/TOOL EMPLOYEES (Recruitment tech companies)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Hey [First Name] - saw you work at [HireVue/MyInterview/etc].

Not trying to bash your product - AI screening is the future.

But I'm seeing companies get hit with EEOC complaints because they don't understand HOW to use these tools compliantly.

The vendor gives them the tech, but nobody teaches them:
- When bias audits are required
- How to notify candidates
- How to document decision-making

I help your customers stay compliant (which keeps them as your customers).

Any chance you have a partnerships person I could connect with? Might be a win-win.

DM #7: FOLLOW-UP (If they don't respond within 24 hours)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[First Name] - following up on my message yesterday.

I know you're busy. If AI compliance isn't a priority right now, totally understand.

But if you DO use AI screening tools and haven't done a bias audit, you're at risk.

One EEOC complaint = $50K+ in legal fees.
Getting compliant = $3-5K and 2 weeks.

Simple math.

Let me know if you want to chat this week.

DM #8: BREAK-UP MESSAGE (If they don't respond after 2 follow-ups)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[First Name] - last message from me, promise!

If you're not interested in the compliance audit, no worries.

But if you ARE using AI screening and haven't gotten compliant yet, can I ask what's holding you back?

- Don't think it applies to you?
- Already have it handled internally?
- Just not a priority right now?

Genuinely curious - helps me understand what HR leaders need.

Either way, if you ever need help with this stuff, you know where to find me.

RESPONSE HANDLING GUIDE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IF THEY SAY: "We don't use AI screening"
YOUR RESPONSE:
"Got it! Out of curiosity, what do you use for early-stage screening?
(Asking because some tools have AI built in and companies don't realize it -
Workday, Greenhouse, etc. have AI modules that trigger compliance rules)"

---

IF THEY SAY: "We're already compliant"
YOUR RESPONSE:
"That's great - you're ahead of 90% of companies!
Can I ask who did your bias audit? And when was your last one?
(NYC requires annual audits, so even if you did one in 2024, you need a new one for 2025)"

---

IF THEY SAY: "Our vendor handles compliance"
YOUR RESPONSE:
"I hear that a lot! But just FYI - the vendor gives you the tool,
but YOU'RE the employer, so YOU'RE legally liable.
HireVue can't get sued for your hiring decisions - you can.
Worth confirming who actually owns the bias audit."

---

IF THEY SAY: "How much does this cost?"
YOUR RESPONSE:
"Depends on your volume and which tools you're using, but typically:
- Compliance audit + documentation: $3-5K
- Ongoing monitoring: $500-1K/month
VS. One EEOC lawsuit: $50-500K in legal fees
Want me to send you a detailed breakdown?"

---

IF THEY SAY: "Can you send me more info?"
YOUR RESPONSE:
"Absolutely! What specifically would be most helpful?
- Breakdown of laws by state?
- Case studies of companies that got sued?
- Sample bias audit report?
Or easier - want to hop on a 10-min call and I'll just walk you through it?"
