EMAIL #2: 24-HOUR NUDGE (If they don't respond to Email #1)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Subject: Re: [Company Name] AI compliance gaps

[Name],

Following up on yesterday's call.

I know you're probably running this by legal or your team. Smart move.

One thing to share with them: I talked to a company last week that waited 6 months to get compliant. In month 4, they got an EEOC complaint.

Their lawyer told them: "Why didn't you handle this when you first learned about it?"

That's called willful negligence. Turns a $50K settlement into a $200K judgment.

Not trying to rush you - just want you to have all the facts.

Let me know what questions come up.

Best,
JP

EMAIL #3: VALUE-ADD EMAIL (3 days after call)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Subject: The 3 most common EEOC complaints against AI screening

[Name],

Haven't heard back, so figured I'd send something useful while you're deciding.

Here are the 3 most common EEOC complaints against companies using AI screening:

1. DISPARATE IMPACT (Title VII)
Claim: "Your AI rejected more [protected class] candidates than others"
Why it succeeds: You can't prove your tool ISN'T biased without a bias audit

2. FAILURE TO ACCOMMODATE (ADA)
Claim: "I have a disability and your AI video interview discriminated against me"
Why it succeeds: You didn't offer alternative screening methods

3. AGE DISCRIMINATION (ADEA)
Claim: "Your AI favored younger candidates based on voice/video analysis"
Why it succeeds: You can't explain how your AI makes decisions

All three are preventable with proper documentation.

That's what the audit gives you - the documentation to DEFEND against these claims.

Still interested? Let me know.

Best,
JP

P.S. - If you want, I can send you the actual EEOC guidance on AI hiring. Takes 5 minutes to read, and it'll make the risk crystal clear.

EMAIL #4: BREAK-UP EMAIL (7 days after call)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Subject: Closing the loop

[Name],

Haven't heard from you, so I'm assuming this isn't a priority right now.

No worries - I get it. Compliance isn't sexy. It's boring until you need it.

Before I close the loop, can I ask:

What's holding you back?
- Cost?
- Timing?
- Don't think it applies to you?
- Already handling it internally?

Genuinely curious. Helps me understand what HR leaders need.

If you ever want to revisit this, you know where to find me.

Best,
JP
JP@DEFENSIBLEHIRINGAI.COM

P.S. - One last thing: If you DO get an EEOC complaint in the next year, feel free to reach out. I can help with response strategy even if we don't work together now.

EMAIL #5: THE ZOMBIE EMAIL (30 days later - re-engage cold leads)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Subject: [Company Name] + AI screening - checking in

[Name],

It's been a month since we talked about AI compliance.

Quick question: Did you end up getting this handled? Or is it still on the back burner?

I ask because I've seen 3 companies get EEOC complaints in the last 30 days. All using AI screening tools. None had bias audits.

All three are now paying $50K+ in legal fees.

If you haven't gotten compliant yet, we should talk. I can get you done in 2 weeks.

If you DID get compliant, awesome - who'd you work with? Always curious what other firms are doing.

Let me know.

Best,
JP

EMAIL #6: THE NEWS HOOK (Send when relevant news breaks)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Subject: Did you see this? [Company] sued over AI hiring

[Name],

Not sure if you saw this, but [Company Name] just got hit with a class-action lawsuit over their AI screening tool.

[Link to news article]

Key quote from the complaint:
"[Company] used AI to screen thousands of candidates without conducting bias audits or providing alternative screening methods, in violation of NYC Local Law 144 and California AB 2013."

This is exactly what we talked about on our call.

They're looking at $5-10 million in damages.

You're using [their AI tool]. You have [X] compliance gaps.

Do you want to wait and see if you're next?

Or do you want to get compliant NOW?

Let me know. I can start Monday.

Best,
JP

EMAIL #8: THE REFERRAL ASK (For people who said "not right now")
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Subject: Quick favor?

[Name],

I know AI compliance isn't a priority for you right now - totally understand.

But I'm trying to help 50 companies get compliant before we see a wave of lawsuits (I think we're 6 months out from that).

Do you know anyone in your network who:
- Uses AI screening tools (HireVue, MyInterview, etc.)
- Is in NYC, CA, IL, CO, or MD
- Should probably be thinking about this?

If you can intro me to 2-3 people, I'd really appreciate it.

Happy to comp you a free compliance review if you ever need it down the road.

Thanks!

EMAIL #9: THE LAWSUIT CASE STUDY (High-value content piece)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Subject: Case study: How [Company] avoided a $2M lawsuit

[Name],

Thought you might find this interesting.

I worked with a company last year that was using HireVue to screen 10,000+ candidates/year.

They had ZERO bias audits. No documentation. No policies.

Then a candidate filed an EEOC complaint claiming race discrimination.

The EEOC started investigating.

Here's what we did:
1. Emergency audit (completed in 1 week)
2. Commissioned bias audit from third-party firm
3. Implemented new AI governance policy
4. Documented all historical decision-making (as much as possible)

Result: EEOC closed the investigation with no findings.

Why? Because we showed PROOF that the company took compliance seriously.

Cost to client: $8,500 (emergency rate)
Cost if we hadn't intervened: $500K-2M (estimated legal fees + settlement)

They got lucky. They had time to fix it before it escalated.

You might not.

Want to avoid being in that position? Let's get you compliant NOW.

JP

EMAIL #10: THE PERSONAL STORY (Builds trust + authority)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Subject: Why I'm obsessed with AI compliance

[Name],

Quick personal story.

In 2023, I watched a friend get rejected by 47 companies in 3 months. All using AI screening.

She had 10 years of HR experience. She was qualified. She never spoke to a human.

She later found out that one of the AI tools flagged her as "low energy" because she has a speech impediment.

That's when I realized: AI screening is powerful, but it's also dangerous.

Companies don't mean to discriminate. But they're using tools they don't understand.

That's why I started Defensible Hiring AI.

I help companies use AI RESPONSIBLY. Not to eliminate it, but to make sure it's fair.

If you care about this stuff - if you want to do hiring RIGHT - let's talk.

I'm not here to scare you. I'm here to help you.

Best,
JP
