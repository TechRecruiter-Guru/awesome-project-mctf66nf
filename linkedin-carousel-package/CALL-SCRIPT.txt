SALES CALL SCRIPT: AI COMPLIANCE AUDIT CLOSE
15-Minute Discovery → Close → $3,000-5,000 Deal
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

GOAL: Get them to say YES to a 2-week compliance engagement TODAY

KEY PSYCHOLOGY:
- Position yourself as the expert doctor diagnosing a disease
- They already have the disease (non-compliance)
- You're offering the cure at 10% of the cost of surgery (lawsuit)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 1: OPENING (60 seconds)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

YOU:
"Hey [Name], thanks for jumping on. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this tight.

Real quick - what made you reach out about the compliance audit?"

[Let them talk. Listen for pain points: EEOC fear, legal pressure, vendor concerns]

YOU:
"Got it. So just to level set - are you currently using any AI screening tools? Like HireVue, MyInterview, Spark Hire, or anything built into your ATS?"

[If YES → Continue. If NO → Ask about resume screening, automated rejections, anything algorithmic]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 2: DIAGNOSIS - Ask These 8 Questions (3 minutes)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

YOU:
"Perfect. Let me ask you 8 quick questions - same ones from my LinkedIn audit. This'll tell us exactly where your gaps are."

[Ask each question. Track their answers. Count the NO's]

1. "Have you completed a bias audit in the last 12 months?"
2. "Do you notify candidates 10+ days before using AI screening?"
3. "Is your bias audit publicly posted online?"
4. "Do you offer alternative screening methods when candidates request them?"
5. "Do you get written consent before AI video analysis?"
6. "Can you explain exactly HOW your AI tool makes decisions?"
7. "Do you have human review for every AI rejection?"
8. "Have you tested your tool for age, race, and disability discrimination?"

[After all 8 questions...]

YOU:
"Okay, so you answered NO to [X] out of 8. Let me tell you what that means..."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 3: THE FEAR INJECTION (2 minutes)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IF THEY SCORED 6-8 NO'S:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
YOU:
"[Name], I'm going to be straight with you. You're in the red zone.

If a candidate filed an EEOC complaint tomorrow, here's what happens:

Day 1: EEOC opens an investigation
Week 1: You're scrambling to find documentation that doesn't exist
Week 2: You hire an employment lawyer at $500/hour
Month 1-3: Discovery, depositions, stress
Month 6-12: Settlement talks or trial prep

Average cost: $75,000 in legal fees. And that's if you SETTLE.

If it goes to trial and you lose? We're talking $200K-500K.

All because you didn't spend $3,000 to get compliant upfront.

Does that make sense?"

IF THEY SCORED 3-5 NO'S:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
YOU:
"[Name], you're in the yellow zone. Not critical, but you have significant gaps.

The problem is, you don't know WHICH candidate is going to file a complaint.

It could be the one you rejected yesterday. It could be one from 6 months ago.

And when that complaint comes, the EEOC doesn't care that you 'didn't know.'

They care about one thing: Can you prove your hiring process isn't discriminatory?

Right now, you can't. And that's a $50K-100K risk sitting on your desk."

IF THEY SCORED 0-2 NO'S:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
YOU:
"[Name], you're actually doing better than 90% of companies.

But here's the thing - compliance isn't binary. You're not 'compliant' or 'not compliant.'

You're 'defensible' or 'indefensible.'

Those 2 gaps you have? That's all an employment lawyer needs to build a case.

Let me ask you this: if you got sued tomorrow, could you find all your documentation in 24 hours?

[They'll say no]

That's what I help with. Making you DEFENSIBLE, not just compliant."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 4: THE SOLUTION (2 minutes)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

YOU:
"Here's what I recommend.

I do a 2-week Defensible Hiring Audit. Here's what that includes:

Week 1: Full documentation audit
- Review your AI tool contracts
- Map your candidate workflow
- Identify every compliance gap
- Build your defensibility documentation

Week 2: Implementation roadmap
- Write your AI governance policy
- Set up bias audit protocol (or connect you with auditor)
- Create EEOC response templates
- Train your team on new process

At the end, you have a compliance binder that answers every EEOC question.

If you get sued in 3 years, you pull out that binder and say:
'We did our diligence. Here's the proof.'

That binder is worth $500,000 in lawsuit protection.

And it costs you $3,500.

Make sense?"

[PAUSE. Let them process.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 5: HANDLE OBJECTIONS (3 minutes)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OBJECTION #1: "I need to talk to legal/my boss/the team"
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
YOU:
"Totally understand. What questions do you think they'll have?

[Let them answer]

Here's what I'd recommend: Let me send you a one-page summary - shows the gaps we found, the risks, and the cost to fix.

You can forward that to [legal/boss/team] and they'll see exactly what we're talking about.

I can also jump on a 10-minute call with them if that helps.

But here's the thing - every day you wait is another day of exposure.

If we start Monday, you're compliant by end of month.
If we start in 2 weeks, you're exposed for 2 more weeks.

Can we at least lock in the start date, and you confirm with your team over the weekend?"

OBJECTION #2: "That's expensive"
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
YOU:
"I hear you. Let me reframe it:

$3,500 = Compliance audit + defensibility documentation
$75,000 = Average cost of defending ONE EEOC complaint

If there's even a 5% chance of getting sued in the next 3 years, this is a no-brainer.

But let me ask you this: how many candidates have you screened with AI in the last year?

[They'll say a number, let's say 500]

500 candidates. If even ONE of them files a complaint, you're looking at $50K minimum.

So you're paying $7 per candidate to protect yourself from a $50,000 risk.

Does that math work for you?"

OBJECTION #3: "Can we do this in 6 months / next quarter?"
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
YOU:
"[Name], let me be honest with you.

You CAN wait 6 months. Nothing's stopping you.

But here's what happens in 6 months:

Option A: Nothing happens. You roll the dice and win. Great.

Option B: Someone files a complaint. Now you're defending a lawsuit WITHOUT documentation.

Your lawyer asks: 'Why didn't you get compliant when you knew about the risk?'

That's called 'willful negligence.' That's how a $50K settlement becomes a $200K judgment.

I'm not trying to scare you. I'm trying to save you money.

If you start now, you're protected by February.
If you wait, you're rolling dice with $100K+ on the line.

Which makes more sense?"

OBJECTION #4: "Our vendor said they handle compliance"
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
YOU:
"Great question. I hear that a lot.

Here's the reality: Your vendor provides the TOOL. You're the EMPLOYER.

When an EEOC complaint gets filed, they don't sue HireVue. They sue YOU.

HireVue isn't making hiring decisions. You are.

So even if HireVue does their own bias audits, that doesn't cover YOUR usage.

You need to show:
- How YOU use the tool
- How YOU review AI recommendations
- How YOU ensure no discrimination

That's what I help with. Vendor compliance doesn't equal employer compliance.

Make sense?"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 6: THE CLOSE (2 minutes)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

YOU:
"So [Name], here's what I'm hearing:

- You're using AI screening [list their tool]
- You have [X] compliance gaps
- You know this is a risk
- You want to get it handled

The question is: do you want to handle it NOW, or after you get sued?

If we start Monday, I'll have your audit done by [DATE].

You'll have your defensibility binder, your policies, your training materials.

And you'll sleep better knowing you're protected.

Cost is $3,500. I can take a card today, or invoice you if you need to run it through AP.

What works better for you?"

[SHUT UP. Wait for them to respond.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CLOSING VARIATIONS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE ASSUMPTIVE CLOSE:
"So let me get started - I'll need access to your ATS and your AI tool contracts. Can you send those over today or tomorrow?"

THE CHOICE CLOSE:
"Do you want to start Monday or Wednesday? Monday gets you compliant faster, but Wednesday gives you time to prep your team."

THE TAKEAWAY CLOSE:
"I'm booked for the next 3 weeks, but I can squeeze you in if we start Monday. After that, you'd be looking at mid-February. What makes more sense?"

THE DIRECT CLOSE:
"Look, you know you need this. I know you need this. Let's just get it done. Can I send you the agreement today?"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 7: AFTER THEY SAY YES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

YOU:
"Perfect. Here's what happens next:

1. I'll send you the service agreement today - just needs a signature
2. Payment: $3,500 via card, check, or wire (or $1,750 upfront + $1,750 on delivery)
3. Kickoff call Monday at [TIME] - 30 minutes
4. I'll need access to your ATS, AI tool, and any hiring docs you have
5. You'll have your full audit report by [DATE]

Sound good?"

[Confirm everything. Send agreement immediately.]

YOU:
"One last thing - do you know anyone else in your network using AI screening who should probably do this too?

I'm doing these audits all month, and I know most HR leaders don't even realize they're non-compliant.

If you want to intro me, I'm happy to give them the same deal."
