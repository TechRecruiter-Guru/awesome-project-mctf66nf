VERSION 1: DIRECT FEAR (Recommended for cold audience)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Used MyInterview, HireVue, or any AI screening tool in the last 90 days?

You might owe $150,000+ in fines.

Most companies using AI hiring tools are breaking multiple laws right now:

• NYC Local Law 144: $1,500/day for missing bias audits
• California AB 2013: Private right of action for violations
• Illinois HB 2557: Consent violations = lawsuits
• Federal EEOC: Disparate impact liability

I built an 8-question compliance audit. Swipe through and count your ❌'s.

If you scored 3+ violations, you need to act NOW. One EEOC complaint and you're looking at $50K in legal fees minimum.

I help companies get compliant in 2 weeks before they get hit.

VERSION 2: AUTHORITY + STORY (Recommended for warm audience)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A client called me last week in a panic.

They'd been using HireVue for 18 months. Zero bias audits. No candidate notifications. No adverse impact testing.

Then they got an EEOC complaint.

$75,000 in legal fees later, they wished they'd spent $3,000 to get compliant upfront.

Here's the reality: most companies using AI screening tools are non-compliant with 2025/2026 regulations.

I created an 8-question audit to help you check. Swipe through and count your ❌'s.

How many did you get?

0-2: You're ahead of most companies
3-5: Significant gaps that need fixing
6-8: HIGH RISK - Act immediately

The cost to GET compliant: ~$3,000
The cost to GET SUED: $50,000-$500,000

Which would you rather pay?

VERSION 3: CONTROVERSIAL TAKE (Recommended for virality)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Unpopular opinion:

If you're using AI screening tools and haven't done a bias audit in 2025, you SHOULD get sued.

Hear me out.

NYC Local Law 144 passed in 2021. It's 2026. You've had YEARS to comply.

California AB 2013 went into effect. Illinois has HB 2557. Colorado, Maryland have their own laws.

And yet 90% of companies using MyInterview, HireVue, Spark Hire are STILL non-compliant.

No bias audits.
No candidate notifications.
No adverse impact testing.
No documentation.

You're filtering out qualified candidates based on opaque AI algorithms you can't explain.

That's not "efficiency." That's discrimination with extra steps.

I built an 8-question compliance check. Swipe through. Count your ❌'s.

If you got 3+, congratulations - you're part of the problem.

(And no, "we didn't know" isn't a legal defense.)

POSTING STRATEGY:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

BEST TIMES TO POST:
- Tuesday-Thursday, 8-9am EST (peak B2B engagement)
- Avoid Mondays (inbox overload) and Fridays (people check out)

ENGAGEMENT TACTICS:
1. Reply to EVERY comment within 5 minutes (shows algorithm you're active)
2. Ask questions in replies: "Which AI tool are you using?"
3. Tag people: "Anyone else seeing this in their recruiting stack?"
4. Comment on 10 related posts RIGHT BEFORE you post (primes algorithm)

HASHTAG STRATEGY:
- Mix of broad (#HRCompliance) and specific (#LocalLaw144)
- 3-5 hashtags max (LinkedIn penalizes over-hashtaging)
- Check hashtag followers: aim for 10K-500K range

FOLLOW-UP:
- Post carousel at 8am
- Boost engagement 8am-12pm (reply, comment, engage)
- Send DMs starting at 12pm (after people have engaged)
- Follow up on DMs at 5pm (end of workday check-in)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

MY RECOMMENDATION:
Start with VERSION 1 (Direct Fear) for maximum immediate response.
If that gets 20+ engagements, repost VERSION 3 (Controversial) in 4 days.
