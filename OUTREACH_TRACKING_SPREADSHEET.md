### Afternoon (2 PM):
5. Research 5 new contacts (LinkedIn + Hunter.io)
6. Fill in: Contact Name, Title, Email
7. Send 5 emails using appropriate template
8. Update "Sent Date" column immediately

### Evening (6 PM):

---

## 🎯 WEEKLY REVIEW (Every Friday)

**Questions to Ask:**
1. Which email template got the most replies? (Use more of that one)
2. Which companies opened 2+ times but didn't reply? (They're interested - call them out)
3. Which objections came up most? (Refine your responses)
4. What personalization worked best? (Recent news mention? Competitor reference?)
5. Are Tier 1 prospects responding better than Tier 2/3? (Adjust focus)

**Iterate:**
- If Template A got 5 replies and Template B got 0 → Use Template A for all future
- If "Too expensive" objection comes up 3+ times → Add ROI calculator to email
- If "We don't use AI" comes up → Add checklist of what qualifies as AI

## 💡 PRO TIPS

**Tip 1: Use Gmail Labels**
Create labels: "Defensible Hiring - Sent", "DH - Replied", "DH - Demo Booked", "DH - Proposal"
Move emails through pipeline visually.

**Tip 2: Set Up Canned Responses**
Gmail Settings → Advanced → Enable "Canned Responses"
Save your most common replies as templates for speed.

**Tip 3: LinkedIn Connection First**
Before cold email, send LinkedIn connection request: "Hi [Name], I'm researching AI hiring compliance for NYC companies like [Company]. Would love to connect."
48 hours later → Send cold email (now they recognize your name).

**Tip 4: Track Competitor Intel**
Add column: "What solution are they using now?"
If 5+ companies say "We use [Competitor]", you know your competitive landscape.

**Tip 5: Ask for Referrals**
After closing customer #1, immediately ask: "Do you know 2 other HR leaders facing the same compliance challenge?"
Referrals close 3X faster than cold outreach.
