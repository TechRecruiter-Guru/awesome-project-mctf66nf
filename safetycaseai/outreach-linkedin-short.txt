[First Name] - saw [Company] raised [Round]. Congrats!

Most robotics CTOs hit 2 bottlenecks post-funding:
1. Compliance (6-12 months, $500K)
2. Hiring (90+ days per engineer, $30K fees)

We solve both for $15K: Instant safety case + 12-month recruiting access to Microsoft/NVIDIA/Intel networks.

Worth 15 min to see if this accelerates your timeline?

Hi [First Name],

Congrats on [Company] raising [Round] for [specific use case]. Impressive traction.

I'm reaching out because I've placed 1,000+ robotics engineers at Microsoft, Intel, NVIDIA, Boston Dynamics over 27 years - and I keep seeing the same pattern:

Founders raise → spend 6 months on compliance → spend another 6 months hiring → market window closes.

We built SafetyCaseAI to compress both bottlenecks into 90 days:

**$15K Full Stack Bundle:**
→ Safety case website (Instant delivery, not 6-12 months)
→ Pre-vetted robotics talent from our 10-year network
→ No placement fees on first 3 hires (save $60K-$90K)
→ 14-day average time-to-offer (vs. 90 days)

**The unfair advantage:**
Our compliance tech is replicable. Our recruiting network isn't. We've been placing robotics engineers since 2012 - before physical AI was a category.

When we call senior perception engineers at Waymo, they pick up. When recruiters cold-message on LinkedIn, they get blocked.

**Two options:**
1. You're our client (we solve compliance + talent)
2. You're a source company (your team becomes our network)

Either way works. Which makes sense for [Company]?

P.S. - We do stealth recruiting. Your competitors won't know you're hiring until offers are signed.
