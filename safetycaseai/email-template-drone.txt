SUBJECT: EASA/FAA drone compliance acceleration for [COMPANY]

---

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Your [SPECIFIC_DRONE_PROJECT] at [COMPANY] aligns perfectly with SafetyCase.AI's mission.

With EU drone regulations tightening (U-Space, EASA Easy Access), how much time does [COMPANY] spend on safety documentation for certification?

We automate this:
• Upload VTOL/delivery drone safety case PDFs
• AI extracts airworthiness data, risk mitigations, test results
• 48-hour turnaround → certification-ready compliance site
• FAA Part 135, EASA STS-01/02 formatted

Price: $2,000 (vs. $50k+ aviation consultants)

Demo this week? I'll show you a delivery drone safety case.
