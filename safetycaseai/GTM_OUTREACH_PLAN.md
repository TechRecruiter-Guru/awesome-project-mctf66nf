## 📧 Email Templates

### **Template 1: Humanoid Robotics CTOs**

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Safety case bottleneck for [Company] Series B?"
- "How Figure/Apptronik accelerate ISO 13482 compliance"
- "48-hour safety documentation for humanoid deployments"

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because [specific detail from "Why Selected" - e.g., "your work on Apollo's collaborative safety design at Apptronik"] caught my attention.

Quick question: How long does it typically take [Company] to compile safety case documentation for investor due diligence or customer deployments?

We just launched SafetyCase.AI—it turns your safety case PDFs into professional, compliant websites in 48 hours using Claude AI. We've seen Series B humanoid startups cut this from 3-4 weeks (and $50k+ in consultant fees) down to 2 days for $2,000.

**5 templates tailored for:**
- Humanoid robots (your Apollo use case)
- AMRs, Cobots, Drones, Inspection robots

**Outputs:**
✓ ISO 13482 / IEC 61508 formatted
✓ Investor-ready compliance dashboards
✓ Self-hosted HTML (no vendor lock-in)
✓ AI-extracted from your existing PDFs

Would a 15-min demo this week make sense? I can show you a live humanoid robot safety case we generated.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Title]
SafetyCase.AI
https://safety-topaz.vercel.app

P.S. If Series B is on your roadmap for 2025, this could save you weeks in due diligence prep.
```

### **Template 2: AMR CTOs**

**Subject:** "AMR safety compliance shortcut for [Company]"

```
Hi [First Name],

Saw your work on [specific AMR project] at [Company]—impressive autonomous navigation safety protocols.

When [Company]'s enterprise customers request safety case documentation for warehouse deployments, how fast can you turn that around today?

We built SafetyCase.AI to solve this exact bottleneck for Series A/B AMR startups:

**Input:** Your existing safety PDFs
**Output (48 hrs):** Professional compliance website with:
- Risk assessment matrices
- Testing validation reports
- Certification-ready formats (ISO 3691-4, ANSI B56.5)
- Live safety dashboards

**The kicker:** $2,000 vs. typical $40-60k consultant engagements.

15-min demo to see an AMR safety case in action?

[Calendly link]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### **Template 3: Cobot CTOs**

**Subject:** "How collaborative robots prove safety for ISO/TS 15066"

```
Hi [First Name],

[Personalized opener based on their cobot work]

Question: When industrial partners require ISO/TS 15066 compliance documentation for your cobots, what's your current workflow?

SafetyCase.AI automates the grunt work:
1. Upload your safety case PDF
2. AI extracts risk assessments, force/power limits, test data
3. 48 hours → professional website with compliance dashboards
4. Share with partners, investors, or self-host

Built specifically for collaborative robotics with templates covering:
- Power/Force limiting compliance
- HRI safety validations
- Contact force test matrices

Would love to show you a cobot safety case we built. 15 min this week?

### **Template 4: Drone CTOs (EU Focus)**

**Subject:** "EASA/FAA drone compliance acceleration"

```
Hi [First Name],

Your [specific drone project] at [Company] aligns perfectly with SafetyCase.AI's mission.

With EU drone regulations tightening (U-Space, EASA Easy Access), how much time does [Company] spend on safety documentation for certification?

We automate this:
- Upload VTOL/delivery drone safety case PDFs
- AI extracts airworthiness data, risk mitigations, test results
- 48-hour turnaround → certification-ready compliance site
- FAA Part 135, EASA STS-01/02 formatted

**Price:** $2,000 (vs. $50k+ aviation consultants)

Demo this week? I'll show you a delivery drone safety case.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### **Template 5: Inspection Robot CTOs**

**Subject:** "Inspection robot compliance for hazardous environments"

```
Hi [First Name],

Reaching out because [specific inspection use case] requires rigorous safety documentation.

When customers deploy [Company]'s robots in confined spaces/hazardous zones, how do you handle ATEX/IECEx compliance documentation?

SafetyCase.AI:
✓ AI-powered extraction from your safety PDFs
✓ Hazard zone classification matrices
✓ Intrinsic safety validations
✓ Professional compliance dashboards (48 hrs, $2k)

Relevant for oil/gas, nuclear, industrial inspection deployments.

15-min demo?

**Option 2: Semi-Automated**
- Mailchimp (but personalization limited)
- Lemlist (better for sales sequences)
- Instantly.ai (AI-powered personalization)

**Recommendation:** Start manual for first 35, then use Lemlist for remaining 65.

### **Email Tracking:**
- Mailtrack (Gmail extension) - see who opens
- Hunter.io - verify email addresses before sending
- Clearbit - enrich contact data

### **Scheduling:**
- Calendly - auto-book demos
- Set 15-min slots, buffer 30 min between

### **CRM (Optional but Recommended):**

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Personalization at Scale:**
1. **Reference their "Why Selected" reason** in first line
2. **Use company-specific pain points** (EU AI Act for EU companies, Series B for late-stage)
3. **Mention their robot by name** (Apollo, Digit, Phoenix, etc.)
4. **Tie to recent news** (funding announcement, partnership, product launch)

### **Spam Avoidance:**
- Send max 50 emails/day from one address
- Use 2+ email addresses if sending 100 (Day 1: 35, Day 2: 35, Day 3: 30)
- Avoid spam trigger words: "free," "guarantee," "limited time" (unless genuine)
- Always include unsubscribe option
- Warm up domain: send 10 emails to yourself/friends first

### **Response Handling:**
**If they reply positively:**
- Respond within 1 hour
- Send Calendly immediately
- Prepare custom demo (use their vertical template)

**If they reply "not interested":**
- Thank them
- Ask if they know anyone who might benefit
- Add to "nurture" list for 6-month check-in

**If they ask "how does it work?"**
- Send 2-min Loom video demo
- Offer live demo
- Send sample safety case HTML

---

## 📞 Demo Script (15-min)

**Agenda:**
1. **Intro (2 min):** Their use case, pain points
2. **Live demo (8 min):** Show their vertical template, walk through order → upload → preview → download
3. **Q&A (3 min):** Pricing, customization, timelines
4. **Close (2 min):** Next steps, trial offer, timeline

**Key Demo Points:**
- Show admin dashboard (you generating codes)
- Upload sample PDF (or skip to preview if no PDF)
- Highlight AI extraction accuracy
- Show editable preview
- Download self-contained HTML
- Emphasize $2k vs. $50k+ alternative

**Trial Offer:**
"Want to test it with your actual safety case PDF? First one is 50% off ($1,000) as a pilot."

---

## 🚨 Common Objections & Responses

**"We already have safety documentation"**
→ "Perfect! SafetyCase.AI makes it customer/investor-facing. Upload your existing PDF, we'll turn it into a professional compliance dashboard in 48 hours."

**"$2,000 seems expensive"**
→ "Compared to $40-60k consultant fees or 3-4 weeks of engineer time? This pays for itself if it saves you one week or lands one enterprise deal requiring compliance docs."

**"We're not fundraising now"**
→ "Makes sense. When enterprise customers request safety case documentation for deployments, this could be relevant. Want to stay in touch for when that timing aligns?"

**"Can we customize the templates?"**
→ "Absolutely. The preview editor lets you modify every field. For heavy customization, we can quote custom template design."

**"What if AI extraction isn't accurate?"**
→ "You review and edit everything before download—AI just saves you 90% of the grunt work. We've seen 85-95% accuracy on structured safety docs."
