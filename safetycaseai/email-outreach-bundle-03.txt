Subject: Should I close your file?

[First Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming one of three things:

1. **Timing's off:** You're heads-down on [specific milestone] and compliance/hiring isn't urgent yet
2. **Already handled:** You've got safety docs + recruiting locked down (rare for pre-Series A, but congrats if so)
3. **Just not interested:** No worries—happy to close your file

Before I do, one last data point:

The average physical AI startup spends **$590K** on compliance consultants ($500K) and recruiting fees ($90K for 3 engineers). Timeline: **12+ months**.

We've brought that down to **$15K** and **90 days** for the Full Stack Bundle:
- Safety case website (Instant delivery)
- 3 engineering hires with no placement fees
- 12-month recruiting support for additional roles

**If you're genuinely slammed right now:**
Reply with "Q1 2026" and I'll ping you in January when fundraising heats up.

**If this just isn't a fit:**
Reply "Not relevant" and I'll remove you from my list—no hard feelings.

**If 15 minutes makes sense:**
[Grab time here] - I'll show you the live demo and you can decide if it's worth $15K to skip 12 months of consultant hell.

Either way, best of luck with [Company]. Building physical AI is hard enough without regulatory quicksand.

Best,

**Quick FAQ:**

**Q: What's the catch with "no placement fees"?**
A: No catch. First 3 hires are included in the $15K bundle. After that, standard 20% placement fees apply (still better than most recruiters' 25-30%).

**Q: What if we only need compliance, not recruiting?**
A: Compliance-only package is $2K (safety case website only). Bundle is for companies scaling teams post-funding.

**Q: How fast can you actually hire robotics engineers?**
A: 14-day average time-to-offer. We maintain a warm pipeline of 200+ candidates from Microsoft, NVIDIA, Intel, Boston Dynamics, Tesla, Waymo. When you say "I need a senior perception engineer," we already know 5 people who fit.
