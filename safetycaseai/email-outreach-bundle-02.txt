Subject: Re: Compliance + recruiting bundle for [Company]?

[First Name],

Following up because this week alone, 3 robotics CTOs told us the same story:

**"Our Series A term sheet required safety documentation. We had design docs and test logs, but no structured safety case. Consultants quoted $300K+ and 9 months. We almost lost the round."**

Then, after they closed funding, they spent another 6 months trying to hire 3-5 robotics engineers at $30K per placement.

That's the exact double-bottleneck we solve:

✅ **Automated extraction:** Our proprietary AI reads your existing docs (PDFs, spreadsheets, CAD files) and generates GSN-compliant safety cases
✅ **Instant delivery:** Upload and pitch VCs the same day with a live website
✅ **Investor-ready format:** Hazard analysis, probabilistic risk models, validation sims—what due diligence teams actually ask for

**PLUS:**
✅ **Pre-vetted robotics talent:** 12-month access to our network (Microsoft, NVIDIA, Intel, Boston Dynamics)
✅ **No placement fees on first 3 hires:** Save $60K-$90K
✅ **14-day average hire time:** vs. 90 days industry standard

**Who this works for:**
- Pre-seed/Series A physical AI (humanoids, drones, AMRs, cobots)
- Companies with prototypes but need both compliance docs AND engineering talent
- CTOs who want to move fast (compliance + hiring in parallel, not sequential)

**Not a fit if:**
- You're post-Series B with dedicated safety + recruiting teams
- You haven't built hardware yet (no test data = nothing to extract)
