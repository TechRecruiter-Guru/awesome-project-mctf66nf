Subject: EU AI Act update - ${COMPANY} compliance status?

Hi ${FIRST_NAME},

The EU AI Act Article 43 (safety documentation for high-risk AI) just got updated with new requirements for autonomous systems.

I'm reaching out because ${COMPANY} operates in ${REGION}, and I've helped 12+ Physical AI companies update their compliance docs to match the new regs.

**What changed (for robotics/autonomous systems):**

1. **Stricter safety case requirements** (Goal Structuring Notation now expected)
2. **AI/ML transparency mandates** (training data, model architecture, fallback mechanisms)
3. **Cyber-physical risk assessments** (not just software, but hardware + environment)
4. **6-month compliance window** (effective ${EFFECTIVE_DATE})

**The scramble:**

Companies with old PDF-based safety docs can't update them fast enough. Consultants are quoting $300K+ and 8-12 months.

We automate this: Upload your existing docs → AI extracts safety data → Generates updated GSN-compliant website → Instant delivery.

**$2K Compliance-Only Package:**
→ Safety case website (EU AI Act compliant, ISO 13482/61508)
→ GSN-validated structure (what auditors require)
→ Adaptive updates for 6 months (as regs evolve)

**Or bundle with recruiting ($15K):**
→ Compliance + 12-month recruiting support
→ No fees on first 3 hires

**Why this matters for ${COMPANY}:**

${EU_CUSTOMERS} will ask for updated compliance docs in due diligence. If you don't have them ready, deals stall.

Worth 15 minutes to review ${COMPANY}'s current compliance status vs. new requirements?

P.S. - If ${COMPANY} already has EU AI Act-compliant docs, ignore this. But most companies don't even know Article 43 changed until customers ask for it.
