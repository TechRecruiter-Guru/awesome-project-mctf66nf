Subject: Your hiring reveals your roadmap (fix this)

Hi [First Name],

When you post "Hiring: Senior Perception Engineer for Humanoid Robots," your competitors learn:
1. You're building humanoids (not AMRs/drones)
2. You're scaling fast (urgency = funding)
3. Exactly which skills you need (they can poach your targets)

**Tesla didn't announce Optimus until the team was in place. You shouldn't either.**

We do **Stealth Mode™ Hiring** for Physical AI companies:

**How it works:**
→ We post anonymously: "Series A Robotics Startup" (not [Company])
→ We describe skills, not projects: "Pattern recognition expert" (not "facial recognition for Product X")
→ Candidates see your name ONLY after NDA + mutual interest
→ Zero public job posts = zero competitor intelligence

**Bonus protection:**
→ 90-day poaching shield: Competitors pay 3x fees to hire your placed talent
→ Competitor alerts: We notify you if rivals try to view your hiring patterns
→ Blind skill matching: No "I only want to work for Google" bias

**The bundle:**

Most founders come to us for compliance ($2K safety case website, Instant delivery).

Then they realize the REAL moat is our recruiting network (10 years, 1,000+ placements, Microsoft/NVIDIA/Intel pipelines).

**$15K Full Stack Bundle:**
→ Safety case website (Instant, GSN-validated)
→ 12-month stealth recruiting support
→ No placement fees on first 3 hires (save $60K-$90K)
→ 14-day average time-to-offer
→ Then: $18K flat fee per hire (not 20-30%)

**vs. Traditional Path:**
- $500K compliance consultants
- $90K recruiting fees (3 engineers @ $30K each)
- 12+ months timeline
- Your roadmap exposed to competitors

You pay $15K. Save $575K. Keep strategy hidden.

Worth 15 minutes to see how stealth recruiting protects [Company]'s moat?

P.S. - We already know 200+ robotics engineers (perception, motion planning, safety, controls) who are passively exploring. When you say "I need someone," we make warm intros same week. No public posts. No competitor signals.
