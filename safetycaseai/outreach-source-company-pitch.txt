Subject: Referral partnership for [Company] engineers?

Hi [First Name],

Different ask than most recruiters.

I'm not trying to poach your team. I'm asking if [Company] wants to be a **source company** in our recruiting network.

**Here's the model:**

We've placed 1,000+ robotics engineers at Microsoft, Intel, NVIDIA, Boston Dynamics, Tesla, Waymo over 27 years. Those placements become our referral sources.

When your engineers are ready to move (2-3 years from now), they come to us first. We place them at top robotics companies. They refer their talented friends. The network compounds.

**What you get:**

1. **Referral fees:** When your alumni place through us, you get $5K per placement
2. **Talent intelligence:** We tell you when competitors are hiring (anonymized data)
3. **Priority access:** If YOU ever need to hire, you skip the line
4. **Free compliance bundle:** Safety case website ($2K value) - on us

**What we get:**

Access to your team when they're ready to move (not now, but eventually). Everyone moves. We want to be their first call.

**Why this works:**

Your best engineers will leave eventually (promotion ceiling, equity vesting, new challenges). You can either:
- Lose them to recruiters who spam LinkedIn (you get nothing)
- Partner with us (you get referral income + talent intelligence)

This is how Microsoft, Intel, and 12+ Series A/B robotics companies work with us.

P.S. - If [Company] needs compliance help NOW (safety case websites), we do that too. Instant delivery, $2K. But the referral partnership is the real long-term value.
