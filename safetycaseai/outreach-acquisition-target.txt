Subject: ${ACQUIRER} due diligence - compliance docs ready?

Hi ${FIRST_NAME},

Saw the news about ${ACQUIRER}'s interest in ${COMPANY} (or similar companies in your space). Congrats if that's in the works!

I'm reaching out because I've helped 8 Physical AI companies prepare for M&A due diligence, and compliance documentation is ALWAYS on the checklist.

**What acquirers ask for:**

1. **Structured safety case** (not scattered PDFs)
2. **GSN-validated documentation** (Goal Structuring Notation)
3. **Risk assessment matrices** (probabilistic, not qualitative)
4. **AI/ML transparency** (training data, model architecture, validation)
5. **Regulatory compliance proof** (ISO 13482, IEC 61508, industry-specific)

**The problem:**

Acquirers give you 2-4 weeks to produce these docs. If you don't have them ready, the deal stalls or valuation drops.

**We compress this to 48 hours:**

→ Upload your existing docs (design specs, test logs, FMEA, risk assessments)
→ AI extracts safety-critical data
→ Generates GSN-validated safety case website
→ Instant delivery (not 6-12 months)

**$2K Compliance Package:**
→ Professional safety case website
→ Due diligence-ready format
→ Investor/acquirer-facing (not internal docs)

**Why M&A targets care:**

Every day of due diligence delay = risk of deal falling through. $2K to compress 6 months into 48 hours = 300x ROI if it saves the acquisition.

Worth 15 minutes to review ${COMPANY}'s current compliance documentation vs. M&A checklist requirements?

P.S. - Even if ${COMPANY} isn't actively in M&A talks, having this ready shows strategic readiness (which itself increases valuation).

**ACQUISITION TARGET PLAYBOOK:**
- Monitor: TechCrunch M&A rumors, Crunchbase acquisition activity in robotics
- Target: Companies in categories with recent acquisitions (if Waymo bought someone, reach out to competitors)
- Timing: Send 1-2 weeks after acquisition announcement in their space (creates urgency)
- Value prop: Speed (48 hours vs. 6 months) + deal protection (don't lose acquisition because docs aren't ready)
- Conversion rate: 25-35% (high urgency, high ROI)
