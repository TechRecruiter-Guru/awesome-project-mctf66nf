Subject: Portfolio company intros - SafetyCaseAI

Hi [VC Name],

I'm John Polhill III - U.S. Air Force veteran and founder of Physical AI Pros. Over 27 years, I've placed 1,000+ robotics engineers at Microsoft (130+ hires), Intel, NVIDIA, Boston Dynamics, Tesla, Waymo.

I built SafetyCaseAI to solve the two bottlenecks killing Physical AI portfolio companies:

**Bottleneck #1: Compliance**
Founders waste 6-12 months and $500K on safety documentation. We automate it: Instant delivery, $2K.

**Bottleneck #2: Talent**
90+ days to hire each robotics engineer. $30K placement fees. We compress to 14 days, no fees on first 3 hires.

**Full Stack Bundle: $15K**
→ Safety case website (Instant, GSN-validated, ISO 13482/61508 compliant)
→ 12-month recruiting support (Microsoft/NVIDIA/Intel networks)
→ No placement fees on first 3 hires (save $60K-$90K)
→ 14-day average time-to-offer
→ Stealth recruiting to protect roadmap
→ Then: $18K flat fee per hire (not 20-30%)

**Why this matters for your portfolio:**

Your Physical AI companies hit the same pattern:
- Raise Series A → 6 months stuck on compliance → 6 months stuck on hiring → burn 50% runway on non-product work

We compress both into 90 days for $15K (vs. $590K traditional path).

**The unfair advantage:**

Compliance tech is replicable. Our recruiting network isn't.

We've been placing robotics engineers since 2012 - before "physical AI" was a category. 1,000 placements = 1,000 referral sources = compounding network effects competitors can't replicate.

**Portfolio company offer:**

Introduce us to 3+ Physical AI portfolio companies. We'll give your entire portfolio:
→ 20% bundle discount ($12K instead of $15K)
→ Priority recruiting access (24-hour candidate intros)
→ Free compliance audits (we review their existing safety docs)

**Relevant for these portfolio companies:**

- Humanoid robotics (we have ISO 13482 templates)
- Autonomous mobile robots (warehouse, delivery, defense)
- Drones (FAA/EASA compliance)
- Collaborative robots (ISO 10218)
- Inspection/construction robots

Worth 20 minutes to show you the platform + discuss portfolio fit?
