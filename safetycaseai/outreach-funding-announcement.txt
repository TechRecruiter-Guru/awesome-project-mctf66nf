Subject: Congrats on the ${ROUND} - compliance + hiring timeline?

Hi ${FIRST_NAME},

Saw ${COMPANY} just raised ${ROUND} (congrats!). I'm reaching out within 24 hours because I've placed 1,000+ robotics engineers over 27 years, and I keep seeing the same post-funding pattern:

**Week 1-8:** Celebrate, hire lawyers, set up payroll
**Week 9-32:** Stuck on compliance (safety docs for investors/customers)
**Week 33-56:** Stuck on hiring (can't find senior robotics engineers)
**Week 57+:** Market window closing, competitors shipping

**What if you compressed weeks 9-56 into 90 days?**

**$15K Full Stack Bundle:**
→ Safety case website (Instant delivery, not 6-12 months)
→ Pre-vetted robotics talent from Microsoft/NVIDIA/Intel networks
→ No placement fees on first 3 hires (save $60K-$90K)
→ 14-day average time-to-offer (vs. 90 days)

**Why now matters:**

Your investors expect milestones in 12-18 months. If you burn 6 months on compliance + 6 months on hiring, you're already behind.

We've helped 12+ Series A/B robotics companies compress this timeline. Happy to show you how in 15 minutes.

P.S. - I monitor funding announcements daily. If ${COMPANY} needs compliance OR hiring in the next 90 days, now's the time to set it up (before the scramble starts).
