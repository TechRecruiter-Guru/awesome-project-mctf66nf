Subject: Saw your ${ROLE} posting - faster way to fill it

Hi ${FIRST_NAME},

Saw ${COMPANY} is hiring for ${ROLE} (posted ${DAYS_AGO} days ago on LinkedIn).

I'm reaching out because I've placed 1,000+ robotics engineers at Microsoft, Intel, NVIDIA, Boston Dynamics - and I already know 5-7 candidates who fit that profile.

**Here's the problem with public job posts:**

1. **90+ day hiring cycle** (post → screen → interview → offer)
2. **$30K placement fees** (20-30% of first-year salary)
3. **Roadmap exposure** (competitors see you're hiring perception engineers = you're building vision systems)
4. **Poaching risk** (recruiters scrape your post, target same candidates, offer more)

**Our model:**

→ **14-day average hire** (we already have warm candidates)
→ **$18K flat fee** (not 20-30% variable)
→ **Stealth recruiting** (anonymous posts, NDA gateway, zero competitor signals)
→ **90-day poaching shield** (competitors pay 3x to hire your placed talent)

**Bonus:** If you're also stuck on compliance (safety docs for investors/customers), we bundle both:

**$15K Full Stack Bundle:**
→ Safety case website (Instant delivery)
→ 12-month recruiting support
→ No fees on first 3 hires (this ${ROLE} + 2 more)

Worth 15 minutes to see if we can fill this role faster + cheaper than your current pipeline?

P.S. - If this role has been open 30+ days, that's a signal the market is tight. We can intro warm candidates this week (not 90 days from now).

**TIMING TRIGGER:**
- Monitor LinkedIn/Indeed/company career pages daily
- Ideal: Reach out 14-30 days after job posted (they're frustrated but not desperate yet)
- Red flag: 60+ day old posts (they're VERY frustrated, higher conversion)
- Search keywords: "perception engineer," "motion planning," "robotics," "autonomous systems"
