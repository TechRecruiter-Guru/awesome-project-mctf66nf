Subject: ${REFERRER_NAME} suggested I reach out

Hi ${FIRST_NAME},

${REFERRER_NAME} (${REFERRER_TITLE} at ${REFERRER_COMPANY}) suggested I reach out to you.

I placed ${REFERRER_NAME} at ${REFERRER_COMPANY} ${MONTHS_AGO} months ago, and they mentioned ${COMPANY} might be hitting the same compliance + hiring bottlenecks they faced.

**What ${REFERRER_NAME} told me:**

"${REFERRER_COMPANY} wasted 8 months on safety documentation and another 4 months trying to hire robotics engineers. John's network got us 3 senior hires in 6 weeks, and the compliance bundle saved us $400K in consultant fees."

**For ${COMPANY}, this would look like:**

**$15K Full Stack Bundle:**
→ Safety case website (Instant delivery, GSN-validated)
→ 12-month recruiting access (Microsoft/NVIDIA/Intel networks)
→ No placement fees on first 3 hires (save $60K-$90K)
→ 14-day average time-to-offer

**Why warm referrals convert:**

${REFERRER_NAME} isn't getting paid to recommend us. They're just tired of watching fellow Physical AI founders waste runway on the same problems they solved.

Worth 15 minutes to see if this accelerates ${COMPANY}'s hiring + compliance timeline?

P.S. - ${REFERRER_NAME} is happy to chat if you want to verify this (I can intro you). But figured I'd reach out directly first.

**WARM REFERRAL PLAYBOOK:**
- Ask every placement: "Who else in your network is hiring robotics engineers?"
- Ideal referrers: Recently placed candidates (3-6 months in, happy with role)
- Get permission FIRST: "Can I mention your name when I reach out to ${COMPANY}?"
- Follow up with referrer after: "I reached out to ${FIRST_NAME}, here's what I said"
- Conversion rate: 40-60% (vs. 2-5% for cold outreach)
