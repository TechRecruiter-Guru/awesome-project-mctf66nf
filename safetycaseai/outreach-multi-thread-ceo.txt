Subject: ${CTO_NAME} might forward this to you

Hi ${CEO_NAME},

I normally reach out to CTOs, but I'm betting ${CTO_NAME} is too busy to prioritize this (even though it could save ${COMPANY} $575K and 12 months).

**The bottleneck:**

Most Physical AI founders hit the same pattern:
- Raise Series A → 6 months stuck on compliance → 6 months stuck on hiring → market window closes

**The math:**

Traditional path:
- $500K compliance consultants (6-12 months)
- $90K recruiting fees (3 engineers @ $30K each, 90+ days per hire)
- **Total: $590K, 12-18 months timeline**

Our bundle:
- Safety case website (Instant delivery, $2K standalone)
- 12-month recruiting support (no fees on first 3 hires)
- **Total: $15K, 90-day timeline**

**Why CEOs care (not just CTOs):**

1. **Runway preservation:** $575K savings = 3-4 extra months of runway
2. **Investor optics:** Live compliance website + senior hires = milestone credibility
3. **Competitive velocity:** Ship while competitors are stuck in consultant hell

**Why this works:**

Compliance is commoditized (we automate it with AI). Recruiting is our moat (10-year network at Microsoft/NVIDIA/Intel that competitors can't replicate).

Worth 20 minutes to see if this accelerates ${COMPANY}'s Series A roadmap?

P.S. - If ${CTO_NAME} already has compliance + hiring locked down, ignore this. But if they're swamped and these are backburner issues, that's exactly when $15K to compress 12 months into 90 days makes sense.

**MULTI-THREADING STRATEGY:**
- Send to CEO 3-5 days AFTER sending to CTO (if no response)
- CC the CTO on the CEO email (shows you're not going around them)
- Use CEO language: runway, milestones, investor optics (not technical details)
- Best for: Series A/B stage (CEO still involved in hiring decisions)
