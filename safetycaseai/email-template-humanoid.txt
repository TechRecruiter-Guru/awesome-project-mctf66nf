SUBJECT: Safety case bottleneck for [COMPANY] Series B?

---

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I'm reaching out because [SPECIFIC_DETAIL_FROM_WHY_SELECTED] caught my attention.

Quick question: How long does it typically take [COMPANY] to compile safety case documentation for investor due diligence or customer deployments?

We just launched SafetyCase.AI—it turns your safety case PDFs into professional, compliant websites in 48 hours using Claude AI. We've seen Series B humanoid startups cut this from 3-4 weeks (and $50k+ in consultant fees) down to 2 days for $2,000.

5 templates tailored for:
• Humanoid robots (your [ROBOT_NAME] use case)
• AMRs, Cobots, Drones, Inspection robots

Outputs:
✓ ISO 13482 / IEC 61508 formatted
✓ Investor-ready compliance dashboards
✓ Self-hosted HTML (no vendor lock-in)
✓ AI-extracted from your existing PDFs

Would a 15-min demo this week make sense? I can show you a live humanoid robot safety case we generated.

Best,

P.S. If Series B is on your roadmap for 2025, this could save you weeks in due diligence prep.
