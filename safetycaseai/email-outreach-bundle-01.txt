Subject: Compliance + recruiting bundle for [Company]?

Hi [First Name],

Saw [Company] just raised [Round] for [specific use case]. Congrats on the momentum.

Most robotics CTOs hit two bottlenecks after funding:

1️⃣ **Compliance:** 6-12 months waiting for ISO 13482 safety cases ($500K consultants)
2️⃣ **Talent:** 90+ days to hire each robotics engineer ($30K recruiter fees per hire)

We built the only bundle that solves both:

**$15K Full Stack Package:**
→ Safety case website Instantly (GSN-validated, investor-ready)
→ 12 months recruiting support (pre-vetted candidates from Microsoft, NVIDIA, Boston Dynamics)
→ No placement fees on first 3 hires (save $60K-$90K)
→ 14-day average time-to-offer (vs. 90-day industry standard)

**The alternative:**
- $500K compliance consultants + $90K recruiting fees = $590K
- 6-12 months for safety case + 90 days per engineering hire = 12+ months to full team

**Our bundle:**
- $15K total
- Compliance done Instantly, first engineer hired in 14 days
