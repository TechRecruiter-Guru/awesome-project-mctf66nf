### For ATS Vendors:
> "Partner with us to add compliance protection to your ATS. We handle all the infrastructure, you get 30% revenue share and a competitive advantage. Your customers get peace of mind, you get a sticky feature that prevents churn."

## 📞 Questions You Might Have

### Q: Can I sell both products?
**A**: YES! They're completely independent. Sell ATS, sell Institutional Memory, or bundle them.

### Q: How do other ATS companies integrate?
**A**: They send webhooks when AI is used or decisions are made. See `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`

### Q: What about the ATS code that's already in backend/app.py?
**A**: That's Product 1 (your ATS). Lines 1679-2600 have institutional memory integrated, but the STANDALONE version in `institutional-memory-api/` is what you sell to OTHER ATS vendors.

### Q: Which should I focus on first?
**A**: Institutional Memory has higher margins and is more defensible. Start there, use revenue to scale ATS.

### Q: How do I demo this?
**A**: Run `python demo_legal_challenge.py` - shows complete workflow from signup to legal challenge to audit report.
