## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATE (NYC Companies)

**Subject Line Options:**
1. `[Company] ready for NYC Local Law 144 audit?`
2. `Your AI hiring tools triggered LL144 compliance`
3. `NYC just made AI hiring compliance mandatory for [Company]`

**Email Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company] has [NYC offices / NYC headquarters] and likely uses AI in hiring (resume screening, video interviews, or ATS ranking).

As of January 2025, NYC Local Law 144 requires you to:
✓ Audit AI hiring tools annually
✓ Disclose AI usage to candidates
✓ Keep 7-year records for EEOC challenges

If you can't produce these records when challenged, fines start at $500/violation.

For a company processing [X] candidates/month, that's [$X] in potential fines—plus legal defense costs ($250K average).

We built an API that automatically:
- Logs every AI system you use
- Tracks every hiring decision with timestamps
- Generates instant audit packs for legal challenges

Takes 1 hour to integrate with your ATS. Protects every hire from day one.

Want to see a 5-minute demo of the audit pack?

P.S. The first LL144 lawsuit was filed last month. Companies that can prove compliance will settle for $0. Those that can't? $500K+.

Best,
[Your Name]
Founder, Defensible Hiring AI
