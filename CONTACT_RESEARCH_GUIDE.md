3. Google (for verification)

---

## 🎯 STEP-BY-STEP WORKFLOW (Per Company)

### Step 1: Find the Right Person on LinkedIn (2 minutes)

**Target Titles** (in order of priority):
1. **Chief People Officer** (CPO) - Best contact (executive decision maker)
2. **VP of People** / **VP of HR** - Also good (reports to CPO or CEO)
3. **General Counsel** / **Chief Legal Officer** - For compliance-focused pitch
4. **VP of Talent Acquisition** - If HR VP not findable
5. **Chief Compliance Officer** - For highly regulated industries (finance, healthcare)

**LinkedIn Search Process:**

#### Option A: LinkedIn Basic Search (Free)
1. Go to LinkedIn.com
2. In search bar, type: `VP HR [Company Name]`
   - Example: `VP HR Datadog`
3. Click "People" tab
4. Look for current employees with titles containing:
   - "Chief People Officer"
   - "VP of People"
   - "VP of Human Resources"
   - "General Counsel" (if HR not found)

#### Option B: LinkedIn Sales Navigator (Free Trial - More Powerful)
1. Sign up for Sales Navigator free trial: https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/sales-navigator
2. Search → Lead Search
3. Filters:
   - **Company:** Type company name (e.g., "Datadog")
   - **Job Title:** "Chief People Officer" OR "VP HR" OR "General Counsel"
   - **Seniority Level:** VP-level, C-level
4. Results will show exact matches with verified current employment

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Current employee (not past)
- ✅ Title includes "People", "HR", "Talent", or "Legal"
- ✅ Located in NYC/CA/IL (matches compliance jurisdiction)
- ✅ Profile has recent activity (not dormant account)

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ "Recruiting Coordinator" (too junior, won't have budget)
- ❌ "HR Business Partner" (too tactical, not strategic)
- ❌ Past employee (left the company)

**Copy This Info to Your Spreadsheet:**
- **Contact Name:** Sarah Johnson
- **Title:** VP of People
- **Location:** New York, NY (confirms LL144 compliance applies)

---

### Step 2: Find Their Email Using Hunter.io (1 minute)

#### Go to Hunter.io
1. Visit: https://hunter.io/
2. Sign up for free account (50 searches/month)
3. In search bar, type the **company domain**
   - Example: `datadog.com` (NOT "Datadog Inc")

#### Hunter.io Will Show You:
1. **Email Pattern** for the company
   - Example: `{first}.{last}@datadog.com`
   - Or: `{f}{last}@datadog.com`
   - Or: `{first}{last}@datadog.com`

2. **Confidence Score** (Hunter's algorithm predicts if email is valid)
   - 95%+ = Very likely correct
   - 70-94% = Probably correct (test before sending batch)
   - <70% = Risky (manually verify)

3. **Known Emails** (if Hunter has them in database)
   - Sometimes Hunter already knows the exact email for your target contact!

#### Construct the Email Manually:
If Hunter shows pattern but not the specific person:

**Pattern:** `{first}.{last}@datadog.com`
**Contact:** Sarah Johnson
**Email:** sarah.johnson@datadog.com

**Pattern:** `{f}{last}@datadog.com`
**Contact:** Sarah Johnson
**Email:** sjohnson@datadog.com

---

### Step 3: Verify Email (30 seconds - Optional But Recommended)

#### Option A: Hunter's Email Verifier (Free)
1. In Hunter.io, go to "Email Verifier" tab
2. Paste the email you constructed: `sarah.johnson@datadog.com`
3. Hunter will check if:
   - ✅ Email exists (deliverable)
   - ⚠️ Email risky (catch-all domain, might bounce)
   - ❌ Email invalid (doesn't exist)

**Only send to "deliverable" or "risky" emails. Skip "invalid".**

#### Option B: Google Search Verification
1. Google: `"sarah.johnson@datadog.com"`
2. If email appears on any public page (conference speaker bio, press release, company blog), it's confirmed valid
3. If no results, doesn't mean it's wrong—just not publicly listed

---

### Step 4: Add Personalization Note (1 minute)

**Why:** Generic cold emails get ignored. Adding one personalized sentence increases reply rate by 30%.

**What to Look For:**
1. **Recent LinkedIn Post:**
   - Check their LinkedIn profile for recent posts
   - Example: "I saw your post about remote hiring challenges last week—this is directly related."

2. **Company News:**
   - Google: `[Company Name] hiring`
   - Example: "I noticed Datadog just opened a new NYC office—perfect timing for LL144 compliance."

3. **Industry Pain Point:**
   - Example for fintech: "Given Datadog's rapid growth in regulated industries..."
   - Example for healthcare: "With Oscar Health operating in healthcare, compliance is critical..."

4. **Mutual Connection:**
   - Check LinkedIn for shared connections
   - Example: "I noticed we both know [Name] at [Company]."

**Add to Spreadsheet "Notes" Column:**
- `Recent post about remote hiring challenges`
- `Company just opened NYC office - perfect timing for LL144`
- `Fintech company, likely familiar with compliance costs`

## ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING: What If You Can't Find the Contact?

### Problem 1: No VP HR on LinkedIn

**Solution:**
- Try alternative titles:
  - `Chief People Officer [Company]`
  - `Head of People [Company]`
  - `Director of HR [Company]`
  - `General Counsel [Company]` (legal angle)

### Problem 2: Multiple People with Same Title

**Solution:**
- Look for seniority indicators:
  - More connections (500+ is good)
  - Recent activity (posted in last 30 days)
  - Location matches compliance state (NYC/CA/IL)
- When in doubt, email the more senior person (CPO > VP > Director)

### Problem 3: Hunter.io Can't Find Email Pattern

**Solution:**
- Try Google: `email [Company Name] HR`
- Check company website: "Contact" or "Careers" page sometimes lists HR contact
- LinkedIn: Some people list email in their profile (rare but check)
- Last resort: Use generic HR email and ask for forwarding:
  - `hr@company.com`: "Hi, please forward to your VP of People or Compliance Officer."

### Problem 4: Email Bounces After Sending

**Solution:**
- Update spreadsheet: Mark as "Invalid email"
- Go back to Hunter.io, try alternative pattern
- Or find a different decision maker at same company
- Send LinkedIn message: "Hi [Name], I tried to email you at [email] but it bounced. What's the best way to reach you?"

## 🎯 EFFICIENCY HACKS

### Hack 1: LinkedIn Sales Navigator Bulk Export
If you have Sales Navigator trial:
1. Create saved lead list: "NYC CPOs for Defensible Hiring AI"
2. Add all 20 NYC company contacts
3. Export to CSV (includes name, title, company, location)
4. Now you only need Hunter.io for emails (saves 50% of time)

### Hack 2: Hunter.io Bulk Domain Search
Instead of searching one company at a time:
1. Create CSV with all company domains
2. Hunter.io → "Bulk Domain Search" (paid feature, but saves hours)
3. Upload CSV, get all email patterns at once

### Hack 3: Use LinkedIn "People Also Viewed"
If you find VP HR at Datadog:
1. Scroll to "People Also Viewed" section on their profile
2. LinkedIn shows similar people = other VP HRs at other tech companies!
3. Often finds decision makers you didn't know about

### Hack 4: Company Website "Team" or "About" Page
Many companies list their executive team publicly:
1. Google: `[Company Name] leadership team`
2. Often includes names, titles, and sometimes emails
3. Example: `datadog.com/about/leadership`
