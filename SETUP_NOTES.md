## Important Notes

### Frontend Files
- The React files in `frontend/src/` are template structures
- You'll need to set up a proper React development environment
- Install dependencies with `npm install` in the frontend directory
- The code structure provides a starting point - customize as needed

### Backend Files  
- Python Flask application ready to run
- Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your settings

### Development Workflow
1. Set up your development environment
2. Install all dependencies  
3. Configure environment variables
4. Start both frontend and backend servers
5. Begin customizing the generated code for your specific needs

The generated files provide a solid foundation - build upon them to create your application!
